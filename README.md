## Projects

### Alibaba Regions Creator - Python Selenium Web Scraper
Description: This project centers around automating data extraction from Alibaba and AliExpress websites across different regions. I utilized Python Selenium to develop a tool that takes input from an XLSX file containing URLs of products. The automation extracts data such as title, price, image, seller name, and country, and then compiles this information into an output XLSX file. This automation streamlines the process of collecting product information from various regions.

### Aliexpress Regions Creator - Python Selenium Web Scraper
Description: Similar to the previous project, this endeavor focuses on AliExpress websites. With Python Selenium, I've created an automation tool that takes URLs from an input XLSX file, scrapes essential data like title, price, image, seller name, and country, and generates a structured output XLSX file. By automating this process, I've enhanced data collection from diverse regions on AliExpress.
